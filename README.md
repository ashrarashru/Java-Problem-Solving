## Project Description
In this project, I want to cover mid-level problem solving via Java. Each problem-solving method can help you rethink every method, such as searching, sorting, creating a pattern, counting, extracting data, and logical operations, providing hands-on experience with Java fundamentals..

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 8 or higher
- Download it from Oracle's Official Website.
- Java IDE - Any IDE such as:
   - IntelliJ IDEA
   - Eclipse
   - NetBeans

## What I Have Done
In this project, I solve 15 Java programming
1. Find 2nd highest CGPA from 10 students.
2. Sorting CGPA from 10 student list in descending order.
3. Find a CGPA from student list.
4. Find the maximum and minimum number of the random generated number.
5. Count notes from any amount.
6. Number pattern (1 - 5).
7. Find the two lowest baby's heights on the list.
8. Count word, character, vowel and constant from input data.
9. Check if the given data is binary or not.
10. Generate random 8-digit password (where minimum 1 capital letter, 1 small letter, 1 special character and 1 number).
11. Remove vowel from a string.
12. Extract the numbers from the paragraph and calculate the final discounted price.
13. Extract a data from html code.
14. Check if the IP address is valid or not.
15. Check how many questions (5 marks and 10 marks) fills the 100 marks paper.

## How to Run the Tests
- Clone the Repository:

  - Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following:
    - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Java-Problem-Solving.git
    - cd java-assignments
      
- Open in an IDE:
  - Open the folder in any Java IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

- Run the Assignments:

  - Each assignment is saved as a separate .java file. Navigate to the file you want to test.
  - Click the Run button in your IDE to execute the program.
